INSTRUCTIONS

Connect the following pins with a 4-wire ribbon cable:

My Keepon  <->  Arduino
---------       -------
V               A0
Cl              A5
Da              A4
G               GND

Then compile this code to your Arduino.  (Recommended & tested: Arduino Nano v3.)
  
With My Keepon powered off, use the Arduino Serial Monitor (or otherwise connect to the Arduino with your own application, e.g. Max patch MyKeepon.maxpat or standalone MyKeepon.app, which we provide here) at 115200 baud.

Turn on your My Keepon.  You should receive a "My Keepon detected" message.
  
Allowable commands (the closing semicolon is required):
    SOUND PLAY <0...63>;
    SOUND REPEAT <0...63>;
    SOUND DELAY <msec>;
    SOUND STOP;
    SPEED [PAN, TILT, PONSIDE] <0...255>;
    MOVE PAN <-100...100>;
    MOVE TILT <-100...100>;
    MOVE SIDE [CYCLE, CENTERFROMLEFT, RIGHT, CENTERFROMRIGHT, LEFT];
    MOVE PON [UP, HALFDOWN, DOWN, HALFUP];
    MOVE STOP;
    MODE [DANCE, TOUCH];
    MODE TEMPO;
    MODE SLEEP;

Strings that the Arduino can send back to you:
    BUTTON [DANCE, TOUCH] [OFF, ON]
    BUTTON [HEAD, FRONT, BACK, RIGHT, LEFT] [OFF, ON]
    MOTOR [PAN, TILT, SIDE, PON] FINISHED
    MOTOR [PAN, TILT, SIDE, PON] STALLED
    ENCODER TILT [NOREACH, FORWARD, BACK, UP]
    ENCODER PON [HALFDOWN, UP, DOWN, HALFUP]
    ENCODER SIDE [CENTER, RIGHT, LEFT]
    ENCODER PAN [BACK, RIGHT, LEFT, CENTER]
    EMF [PAN, TILT, PONSIDE] [-127...127]
    POSITION [PAN, TILT, PONSIDE] [VAL]
    AUDIO TEMPO [67, 80, 100, 133, 200] (if BPM cannot be detected, this is estimated from power spectral density response)
    AUDIO MEAN [0...64] (the mean of the envelope over a 1.28sec window, max around 64 for very loud music, not updated when motors are moving)
    AUDIO RANGE [0...64] (dynamic range, max 64 for shouting, not updated when motors moving)
    AUDIO ENVELOPE [0...127] (near instantaneous log of the audio amplitude; commented out in code for reduction of data transfer)
    AUDIO BPM [VAL] (estimated beat interval in multiples of 5msec)
